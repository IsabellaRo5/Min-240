          I asked some people if they would be willing to talk about their incident with me and many gave their input into this project:
            <br>
            <br>       
          <b> Did you report your assualt, if no, why not?</b><br>
            <i> "No I did not report my assualt, I was scared of what my family would think of me. I also was very scared what would happen when I went to the police. I took a 2 years going by and another girl being assualted for me to step forward with her and report it. To this day, my parents don't know." </i>
            This is where the idea of adding the proccess of reporting a sexual assualt came in to play.<br>
            <br> <b> What are some things you wished you knew or had?</b><br> 
          <i>" I wish I knew about the Norse Violence Prevention Center, its great that we have it on campus and they really helped me out when I finally turned to them." </i> Providing resources is a main idea for this website and this is one example why.<br>
          <br><b>What are some hopes you have for this project?</b><br>    
            <i>"That people can see other cases like theirs and have a person to interact with. The worst time for me was usally at night and I just felt alone, it would be great to have someone to turn to in that moment, like a forum or a chat room" </i>
            <br><b> I had one user tell me she would be uncomfortable sharing her own experince but would really appreciate the chance to read others stories</b><br>

            I got the idea of The Alone Project from talking to some of my friends who have been sexually assualted. They felt alone and as if no one understood what they went through. I saw a need for a resource to become available so help people look towards the brighter side of life. I also noticed how high the suicide rates for victims was and felt as if resources were more available to victims, it could help.

            <p class="idea">Users will be able to acess not only resources but sucess stories and a help line. A lot of user research I have done has asked for a chat room of sorts to talk to other victims so they can truly feel understood, so this will be another feature available. To keep them safe their will be certain words and phrases banned from our site. We understand that this project, is a sensitive one. We aim to help not hinder our users. Thats why around the site we plan to implement warnings where there is potential triggering matieral. We hope that this project will open up more possibilities for our users.
            Users will gain a community in which everyone will be accepted. They will no longer feel as if its them vs the world but that the world can help them grow. We hope that the user will gain confidence and the support they need to succeed in their life. The user will also gain access to resources they need and this will help them understand that it is okay to ask for help. 
            I have developed a persona to represent what the average user could look like and gain from the website.
            Persona: Age 20, Female, unknown ethnicity, university student
            Name: Amelia 
            Amelia was sexually assualted by her best friend, when she told him no he didn't listen and just kept moving in on her. No one could hear her plees for help and these memories keep her from falling asleep at night. Its the next day and she is not sure what to do, her friends won't believe her and police officers scare her. She isn't sure what to do and decides to look it up to see if she can find out what happens when you report a sexually assualt. Alone pops up with a link to the page with the walkthrough of how to report a sexually assualt, what steps to take and most importantly what happens. She decides to report her assualt but it doesn't just stop bothering her. Her nights are hard and many she spends crying in her dorm feeling so alone. Some of her friends don't believe that he could have done it, and make fun of her behind her back. She feels alone, she remembers the website she came across on the first day and relogs on. She discovers forums and stories and genarl support. She no longer feels alone or like everything is her fault. She is able to move forward and see that she is worth it and it is better to keep living then to give up again.</p>
